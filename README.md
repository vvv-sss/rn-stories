# ðŸ“± RN Stories App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my stories app, where I'm working on creation of collection of interesting use cases showcasing my skills as a React Native developer. ðŸš€

## Motivation

As a passionate React Native developer, I believe in the power of showcasing real-world applications to demonstrate the depth of my skills and experience. Rather than having separate repositories for each project, where a lot of duplications I decided to bring everything together in this dynamic app.

## âœ¨ RN Stories âœ¨

- [Scroll-responsive dynamic header and bottom bar visibility](./screens/stories/hide-bars-on-scroll/hide-bars-on-scroll.md)
- [Permissions Handling](./screens//stories//permissions/permissions.md)

... and many more to come! ðŸš€

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vvv-sss/rn-stories.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd rn-stories
   yarn install

   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start


   ```
