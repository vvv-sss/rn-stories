# ðŸ“± RN Stories App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my stories app, where I've gathering a collection of interesting use cases showcasing my skills as a React Native developer. ðŸš€

## Motivation

As a passionate React Native developer, I believe in the power of showcasing real-world applications to demonstrate the depth of my skills and experience. Rather than having separate repositories for each project, where a lot of duplications I decided to bring everything together in this dynamic app.

## Features

### âœ¨ UI Stories
Dive into a visual feast! Each section of this app explores unique UI designs, demonstrating my ability to craft beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

### ðŸ§  Business Logic (TO BE ADDED)
Explore the brains behind the beauty! Every use case comes with its own set of business logic challenges that I've successfully tackled. From auth flow to asynchronous operations, it's all here.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vvv-sss/rn-stories.git
   
2. **Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd rn-stories
    yarn install
    
3. **Run the app**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
