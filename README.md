# ðŸ“± RN Stories App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my stories app, where I'm working on creation of collection of interesting use cases showcasing my skills as a React Native developer. ðŸš€

## Motivation

As a dedicated React Native developer, I understand the importance of presenting tangible evidence of my capabilities and expertise through real-world applications. In an effort to streamline my portfolio and minimize redundancy, I have chosen to consolidate all my projects within this dynamic application, providing a comprehensive showcase of my skills and experience.

## âœ¨ RN Stories âœ¨

- [Scroll-responsive dynamic header and bottom bar visibility](./screens/stories/hide-bars-on-scroll/hide-bars-on-scroll.md)
- [Permissions handling](./screens//stories//permissions/permissions.md)
- [Dynamic header and custom scroll animation](./screens//stories//dynamic-header/dynamic-header.md)

... and many more to come! ðŸš€
